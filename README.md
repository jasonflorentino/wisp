# ðŸ‘» Wisp (wip)
### ***A Lisp-y language made reading [buildyourownlisp.com](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) by [Daniel Holden](https://github.com/orangeduck)***

I was looking for some resources to learn more about C and came across this wonderful project. In fifteen short but meaningful chapters, Daniel walks you through building a language from scratch. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in C or the inner workings of programming languages. While I can't say I could roll some of the features he teaches on my own yet, I certainly feel more comfortable in my knowledge of C programs and learned some excellent foundations on the design of programming languages. Thanks Daniel!
